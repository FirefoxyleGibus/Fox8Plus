# Fox8Plus
 Fox8+ is an 8bits computer that i made myself with 256B of Ram and 256B of stack.
 It was originally made on Logisim but i decided to emulate it in different programming language
## Currently available version
 You're on the python version, but you can download the C# version here.
 
 A web version was made by [Alekuso](https://github.com/Alekuso) and will be available in some time
## Planned
 I plan to make the Fox8P that could use multiple value in Rom per instructions.
 I'm currently limited in only one 16bits instructions that encode the instruction and parameter.
 
 I also plan to make the Fox16+ with a 16bits bus and 16bits register for more storage, Ram and stack !
